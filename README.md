# Time Series Analysis with Fourier Transform
ğŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes airline passenger data using Fourier Transform techniques.
Extracts seasonal patterns and trends from time series data.
Visualizes power spectrum and identifies dominant frequencies.

ğŸ“Š Features
Data Preprocessing: Parses date and extracts relevant time components.
Fourier Analysis: Computes Fourier coefficients and reconstructs signal.
Visualization:
 - Monthly averages with Fourier estimates.
 - Power spectrum highlighting significant periodicities.

ğŸ“ˆ Results
 - Identifies key seasonal trends in airline passenger traffic.
 - Highlights dominant cycles in the dataset.
